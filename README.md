# ArxConverter

This userscript converts ARX prices to real currencies and updates the values on the Elite Dangerous DLC store automatically.

## Installation

This script runs inside [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/),
so in order for it to work, you have to install the ViolentMonkey Extension from [here](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).  
Once ViolentMonkey is installed, clicking on [https://github.com/ShadowLp174/ArxConverter/raw/main/arx-converter-userscript.user.js](https://github.com/ShadowLp174/ArxConverter/raw/main/arx-converter-userscript.user.js)
should open a prompt asking you if you want to install ArxConverter. Click install and you should be good to go! :)

## Other Currencies

This script can be adjusted to convert to other currencies than Euro.
To do that, you have to replace the discount tiers in the `discountMap` according to the discounts in your currency and change the symbol in `currency` to your desired icon.
